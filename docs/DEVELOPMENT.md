## Development

### Develop with Go-Lang in Linux
1. Get Go-lang from [official site](https://golang.org/dl/). Check out the version used in `GO_VERSION` file at the base of this repository.
2. Add `go` command to your PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`
3. Define GOPATH: `export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)`
4. Add Go workspace to your PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
5. Define the base path: `mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/apache`
6. Clone the project:
   - `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/apache`
   - `git clone <project>`
   - `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/apache/<project>`
7. Define GO111MODULE: `export GO111MODULE=on` to be able to compile locally. 

### GO code guidelines
1. Run `golangci-lint run`
2. Run `go mod tidy`
3. Run `go fmt ./...`
4. Run `go vet ./...`

### Compilation
To compile, type: `go build -o ingress-ats main/main.go`

### Unit Tests
The project includes unit tests for the controller written in Golang and the ATS plugin written in Lua.

To run the Golang unit tests: `go test ./watcher/ && go test ./redis/`

The Lua unit tests use `busted` for testing. `busted` can be installed using `luarocks`:`luarocks install busted`. More information on how to install busted is available [here](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/). 
> :warning: **Note that the project uses Lua 5.1 version**

To run the Lua unit tests: 
- `cd pluginats`
- `busted connect_redis_test.lua` 

### Text-Editor
The repository comes with basic support for both [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

If you're using `vscode`:
- `.vscode/settings.json` contains some basic settings for whitespaces and tabs
- `.vscode/extensions.json` contains a few recommended extensions for this project.
- It is highly recommended to install the Go extension since it contains the code lint this project used during development.
